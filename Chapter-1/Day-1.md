3.Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

 - A transaction can change the data on blockchain thats why it will cost money. -> A script can only view data on blockchain and thats why there is not charge for this.

4. What is the difference between Testnet and Mainnet? When would you develop on each?

 - Testnet -> whenever we want to test our dapp we can deploy that on testnet. by the help of testnet we can do many tests and if we got bug we can fix        that easiy on testnet.
 - Testnet give us blockchain ecosystem.

 - Mainnet ->  When we are sure that our project perform good on testnet and we fixed minor bugs then we can deploy our dapp on mainnet
 - when we deploy on mainnet it means we deployed it on our mainnet address on blockchain.
 - once we deploy our contract on mainnet then we cant edit our contract, thats why it is recommended to test our contract on testnet and then we can          deploy it on mainnet
