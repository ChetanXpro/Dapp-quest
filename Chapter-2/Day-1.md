1. What is the difference between frontend and backend? Can you provide a real life example? Note: You can't use the one in this chapter.

 - Frontend -> Basically our frontend is our client side (User interface) , all the thing a user can see on our website is frontend.
   - for example when we open youtube we see many videos recommandations and when we click on any video it show our that perticular video.
   - we click on subscribe button then it show subscribed.

 - Backend -> backend is server-side of our website when we request something to our backend our backend give response,
   - for example when we open youtube we can see video recommandations , but we dont have that data on our computer so how we can see that data ,
   - basic answer is that when we open yt our fronend request backend and then backend collect vidos from database and send it to our fronend.
   - when we click on any particular video then again our fronend send request to backend and get video in response.

2. What is the difference between global styling and module styling ?

 - global styling will be applying to our whole website and module styling we be applyed to that pertcular component in which we import module stylng.
